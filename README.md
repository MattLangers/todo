# TODO : VUE + API (asp.net core 2.2)

### Front end
This was written using vue as we expect the front end to be dynamic to events, using visual studio code. This is not complete, but we should have the behaviour you would expect in a todo application.

### API backend
This has been knocked up using visual studio.
